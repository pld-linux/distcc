- updated to 2.4
  Changes:
  BUG FIXES:
    * If an IO error occurs while trying to get a lock, bail out rather
      than getting stuck.
    * Don't use the RFC2553 getaddrinfo/getnameinfo API by default,
      because it seems to be slower on OS X and possibly problematic
      on other systems.  It can be enabled with --enable-rfc2553 if
      you want to use IPv6, multi-homed servers, or want to test the
      new API.
